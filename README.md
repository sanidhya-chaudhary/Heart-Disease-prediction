# Heart-Disease-prediction

Early detection of heart diseases is critical in the treatment and management of cardiovascular diseases, wherein machine learning can be a powerful tool in detecting a potential heart disease diagnosis. But they are not detected in the early stages due to the impractical costs of the tests available. Thus, a fast, real-time and reliable system that predicts the chances of a patient having heart disease in an optimized manner is required. 

# The dataset used for this project is Heart Disease UCI. -- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

The dataset consists of 76 attributes; out of which only, 14 attributes are used for our project to predict heart disease.

This system is implemented using the following modules. 

1.) Collection of Dataset 

2.) Data Pre-Processing 

3.) Balancing of Data 

4.) Model Building

5.) Disease Prediction using Trained Model.

Perform Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on features of dataset to analyse relationship among different features. We use correlation matrix which implies correlation values among all features including target also. Heatmap of correlation matrix. Analyse sex feature with target, Age feature with target, and sex, age both with target using box plot and violin plot. Max heart rate with target whether having disease or not using scatter plot.

Like, Supervised learning is the type of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on the basis of that data, machines predict the output. 

# ALGORITHMS used are: -  

SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM): 

RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM

LOGISTIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM

K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Algorithm


# CONCLUSION
After performing the machine learning approach for training and testing we find that accuracy of the KNN algorithm is # 89% 
which is highest among all algorithms

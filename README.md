# Heart-Disease-prediction
Early detection of heart diseases is critical in the treatment and management of cardiovascular diseases, wherein machine learning can be a powerful tool in detecting a potential heart disease diagnosis. But they are not detected in the early stages due to the impractical costs of the tests available. Thus, a fast, real-time and reliable system that predicts the chances of a patient having heart disease in an optimized manner is required.
